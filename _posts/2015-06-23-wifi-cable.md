title : Wifi Cables. For Real.

---

So, [Yagi antenna](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yagi-Uda_antenna) put several parallel $\lambda/2$ dipoles in a long row. One dipole gets excited by the wave, then induces it's excitement to the next element, which passes it along to the next element, and so on until it reaches a receiver.

Wifi is broadcasting at 5 GHz, so $\lambda/2$ is about 3 cm (about one inch). Hence, put a bunch of 3 cm metal wires in parallel into a flat plastic cable, and you have a "conductor" for Wifi signals. A Wifi cable.

Use this to get your Wifi in and out of faraday cages or through wet walls. Next generation local area networking!
