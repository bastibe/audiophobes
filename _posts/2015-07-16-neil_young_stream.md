First off, I really like Young, the Dead Man soundtrack is out of this world and
[Heart of Gold](https://youtu.be/Eh44QPT1mPE), including all the harp-searching is an all-time classic. For me at least.

But his recent endeavors in portable music are peculiar at best. What audio consuming end-user needs the 24 bits/192 kHz Pono offers? Well, at least he is consistent and [has announced the removal of his work from the distribution platform of your choice](https://www.facebook.com/NeilYoung/posts/10155765667375317:0) (sans Pono, of course):

>Streaming has ended for me. I hope this is ok for my fans.
>
>It's not because of the money, although my share (like all the other artists) was dramatically reduced by bad deals made without my consent.
>
>It's about sound quality. I don't need my music to be devalued by the worst quality in the history of broadcasting or any other form of distribution. I don't feel right allowing this to be sold to my fans. It's bad for my music.
>
>For me, It's about making and distributing music people can really hear and feel. I stand for that.
>
>When the quality is back, I'll give it another look. Never say never.

Neil Young

Oh Neil, you silly goose!
