In Xubuntu 15.04, the VMWare Network Module can't compile. Without that module, VMWare can't start.

But as luck would have it, there's [the internet](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iDbyYGrswtg)! And [the internet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet) is full of [crazy people](http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/crazy_people/)! And one of those ([presumably](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zi8VTeDHjcM)) [human beings](https://www.wordnik.com/words/human%20being) [actually fixed this](http://askubuntu.com/questions/614525/15-04-vmware-player-unable-to-start-services-error)!
