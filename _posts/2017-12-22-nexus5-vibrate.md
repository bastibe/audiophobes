We have a couple of Nexus 5 Android smartphones we are planing to use in a study. We use its vibrator to notify subjects. As of today, two devices are not virating anymore. Not in our app or in any other app. A factory reset did not do anything to remedy the situation. Looking up the [Nexus 5 on iFixit](https://ifixit.com/Teardown/Nexus+5+Teardown/19016#s53717) shows the location of the vibrator, glued to the back casing. Enter a guitar pick; open the devcie and have a look-see. Careflly pulling out the contact springs a bit, cleaning the contact pads and reassembling diligently - et voil√†! Christmas is saved.
