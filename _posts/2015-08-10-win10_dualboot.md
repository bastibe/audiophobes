Yes I know!! It seemed a bad idea in the first place and if I wouldn't have been the one affected, I would have laughed my ass off (-.-)

**Just this MESSAGE FOR EVERYONE**:

Do not, and I repeat, do not(!) simply click on "Upgrade" if you have a dual boot setup with Linux, for instance, and a Windows 7 or 8 installation.

In the end, you'll be amazed how ironic Microsoft's upgrade slogan "Sit back and relax" truely is...
