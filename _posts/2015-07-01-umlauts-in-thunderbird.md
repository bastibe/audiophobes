title : Umlauts in Thunderbird

Open an email that contains umlauts in Thunderbird (Linux) in its own tab. Then drag that tab out of the Thunderbird window. Thunderbird then creates a new window for that message. So far, so good.

BUT, in the new window, all umlauts are broken. The new window also contains it's own inbox tab (why?). Switch to that tab, and back to the message window, and the umlauts are fixed again.

In 2015, text encoding is still an issue.
