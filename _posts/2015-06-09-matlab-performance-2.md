title : Matlab Performance II

Using (A simple UDP communications application)[http://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/24525-a-simple-udp-communications-application] is significantly slower on GNU/Linux than on Windows 7 on the same machine (no VMs involved this time), breaking functionality in the process. This also appears to be the case for the (TCP/UDP/IP Toolbox)[http://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/345-tcp-udp-ip-toolbox-2-0-6]. Which makes me wonder, what is going on over at Mathworks?
